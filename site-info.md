## Site Technology

The site is based on a popular blogging platform called wordpress. You can check it out at wordpress.com. All other content is using Google&#8217;s Picasa web albums, Picasa, Facebook badges, Google Documents, Google Calendars and various wordpress widgets as well as some basic web programming that I did.

## What is a blog

I get this question quite a bit. Well simply a blog is an online journal, althought its a bit more in depth than that as there are a lot more things you can do than just write blog/journal entries.

## Why have a blog

I like to write about what I&#8217;m up to and just have a website that I can tinker with. If you head over to my [Personal Projects](http://tygertown.us/blog/?page_id=49) page you can see all the other sites that I have made or am working on. Also, it gives me a great way to keep up on the web technologies especially wordpress which is a super powerful tool for anybody who wants a simple website. You don&#8217;t have to use it as a blog actually, you can easily put different styles on it and move stuff around with the mouse and make it appear very professional. I&#8217;m in the process of learning how to really tweak it and get it to do things like this as there are a lot of not so web savvy people out there that want websites but also want to be able to edit the pages themselves.
