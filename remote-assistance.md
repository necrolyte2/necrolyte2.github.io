This seems to crop up enough that I finally decided to dedicate an entire page on my site to make this process more smoothly.

## The Problem

Somebody has troubles with their computer. It does not matter if it is a difficult problem or just a simple problem, because some problems require you to be at the computer to fix them. How can you get on their computer just to solve even simple problems like setting the correct mic input so you can video chat with somebody(this happens a lot now that I live in Bangkok)

## The Solution

[www.TeamViewer.com](www.teamviewer.com "team viewer")

Each person downloads the application.

The person that will do the fixing will most likely download the full client. From now on I will refer to them as the Technician.

### Client QuickSupport Downloads

<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/link/?url=505374&id=981511824">Windows Client</a>
  
<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/link/?url=505374&id=1495231549">Mac Client</a>

The person that needs help will download the quick help client(They will want to click save instead of run when they download the client). From now I will refer to them as the Client.

### Technician Client Downloads

 <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/link/?url=842558&id=981511824">Windows Technician</a><a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/link/?url=842558&id=1495231549"><br /> Mac Technician</a>

<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/link/?url=842558&id=1495231549"></a>
  
I will go ahead and assume that the person that downloads the full client will know how to use teamviewer and how to install it so I won&#8217;t go into details on that.

Once the Client has downloaded the quick help client they will need to run the application which will present them with this

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-621" title="Client" src="http://tygertown.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ClientScreen-224x300.png" alt="" width="224" height="300" />](http://tygertown.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ClientScreen.png)

The technician will need to run the TeamViewer app which they will then need an ID and Password to connect to the Client.You can see the ID and Password field which they will need to give to the technician.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-620" title="Technician" src="http://tygertown.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Technician-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" />](http://tygertown.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Technician.png)Here you can see the Technician&#8217;s first screen. They will need to put the ID that the Client gives them and then click Connect to partner. Then they will need to type in the password from the client which will then allow the Technician to see the Client&#8217;s screen. They will also have control of the Client&#8217;s mouse and keyboard and can assist them with whatever problem they have.
