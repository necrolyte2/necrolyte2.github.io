So I played Ultimate tonight for the first time in like 5 weeks without my splint. It went very well and didn&#8217;t hurt at all. Also, I was out on my bike for the first time in 5 weeks as well. I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how awesome it is to be able to go do those things again. Looking forward to getting out on the bike again.
