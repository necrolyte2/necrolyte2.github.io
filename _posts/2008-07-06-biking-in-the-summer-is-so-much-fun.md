It really is. When the wind is calm, its about 65-70 degrees its just great. Especially with your friends on a nice easy ride.

I screwed up and didn&#8217;t save the good one I took of course.

We didn&#8217;t make our full trip which was suppose to be from Cottonwood/Huffine all the way through Cottonwood to Highway 181 and then back on Gooch Hill road but it was still really fun.
