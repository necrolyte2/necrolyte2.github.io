Have you ever had one of these scenarios

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://xkcd.com/783/"><img class="aligncenter" title="I Don't want Directions" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/i_dont_want_directions.png" alt="" width="592" height="194" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  More than likely you have had a similar experience to the cartoon. I believe this scenario stems from the days that GPS were not so prevalent. Now people don&#8217;t expect you to be able to pull up maps their neighborhood and pinpoint their house between almost precise street maps and satellite imagery.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  So lets step back a bit and think about the next time that you give directions.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Usually you send out an invite using letters or Facebook or email to your event. People still tend to think that their house or event is hosted in some unexplored part of the world and nobody but them can give the directions to this new place.
</p>

>   Then you turn right at the big yellow sign(Again poor description)

>   We are the little blue house on the left

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Ok, I&#8217;m not going to completely smash these directions as I&#8217;m sure you have dealt with similar ones before, instead let me show you how you can show somebody very easily
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  <p>
    [googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=116437842819168394278.00048e8a0b6e07e2635d6&ll=13.715289,100.490913&spn=0.029184,0.036478&z=14&output=embed&w=425&h=350]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Done! No need to give crazy directions relative to obscure objects. They can see all the ways that might be easiest for them to get where they need to go.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They could even see this on their mobile phone using the Google Maps Mobile
  </p>
