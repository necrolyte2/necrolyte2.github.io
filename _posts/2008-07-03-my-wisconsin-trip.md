<span style="font-style:italic;">First of all if you havn&#8217;t been on the site yet this is my personal blog/website. It has pictures and articles of different things that I do. I keep it pretty well up to date and post at least once a week on here so if your ever wondering what I&#8217;m up to you can always check here</span>

So I had a nice week long vacation back in Cheeseland USA. I was able to see just about all my family back there as everybody was at either at my cousin&#8217;s graduation party or at my other Cousin&#8217;s Wedding.

Here are the links to the albums that I put up on the web for both the wedding and Danny&#8217;s double header.

Feel free to poke around and comment on different things.
