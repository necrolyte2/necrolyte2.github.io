Well I went up there to have the hand specialist look over my x-rays and give me the final word. It seems the bone has indeed slipped a bit but he says it is not surgery worthy. I will most likely have a bump on the back of my hand where it broke and that knuckle will be a bit smaller than the same one on the other hand but that won&#8217;t matter. I get to get rid of this stupid splint next week and can downgrade to taping that finger to another one. The bone should take about 3 months to heal completely.
