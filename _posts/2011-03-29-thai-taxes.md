Just an FYI for anybody looking for info about it and really so next year I remember what i need to do.

### Personal ID or Tax ID

If you don&#8217;t already have one, you need a Personal ID or Tax ID which you can get by filling out. Probably best to get this done right away if you don&#8217;t have one already, but mine only took about 15 minutes to get.

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} span.s1 {font: 12.0px Thonburi} -->

<a title="Thai Tax ID form" href="http://download.rd.go.th/fileadmin/tax_pdf/request/lp101_48_17052007.pdf" target="_blank">ล.ป.10.1</a>

This is in Thai so have fun with that, or if you just do what I did and go to a district office and tell them you don&#8217;t have an ID they will get you one somehow. I had to pay 4 baht for copies to get it though, just FYI. Haha.

### File

Ok, so now you have your PIN or TIN whichever/whatever. Now you need to file.

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} span.s1 {font: 12.0px Thonburi} -->Fill out and print: 

<a title="Thai Tax Form 91" href="http://download.rd.go.th/fileadmin/download/english_form/pnd_91_110354.pdf" target="_blank">ภ.ง.ด.91</a>

Find your district office <a title="Thai Revenue Department District Office Map" href="http://www.rd.go.th/publish/337.0.html" target="_blank">here</a>(or just pick the closest one too you at the time like I did). Hope they have an English speaker there.

&#8212; or &#8212;

<a title="Thai EFile 2010" href="http://rdserver.rd.go.th/publish/index.php" target="_blank">E-File</a>

I couldn&#8217;t do the E-File because I didn&#8217;t have my PIN yet, but maybe next year.
