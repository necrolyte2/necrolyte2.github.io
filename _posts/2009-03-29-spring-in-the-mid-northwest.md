<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just a glimpse at how bad the storms were today across the state. Anything red is a closed road. Anything dotted red means you shouldn&#8217;t be on that road. Yellow is lots of snow. Turquiose is snow and ice.

  I&#8217;m not going to start complaining about how it was so nice out and then the weather got bad like I did last year, because I&#8217;m trying to come to terms with the weather in Montana at this time of year. I don&#8217;t care that its technically Spring, because Montana understands no Spring only Winter and Summer.
