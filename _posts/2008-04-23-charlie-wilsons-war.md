I thought it was good. Good humor and a good view on the whole Afghanistan situation in the 80&#8217;s. Its always tough to know what to think about things like that. The US obviously was looking to thwart the Soviet Union&#8217;s Expansion and had a lot to gain, however, we really did do a poor job of fixing up the place after the party was over. I suspect that the movies viewpoint is scewed a bit towards what we want to think about the whole ordeal. The U.S.S.R could probably do a similar documentary on the Vietnam war that would be similar for them as this movie is for us.
