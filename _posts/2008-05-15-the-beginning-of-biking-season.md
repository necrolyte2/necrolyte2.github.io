Well it finally was nice enough out to get on the bike and go. I did what I said I was going to do and tackled Tripple Tree road.

Tripple Tree is composed of 1 very long and steep hill followed by another large hill. After you get over those two hills you have to turn around as the road turns to gravel.

Its a good leg killer and a nice short hour&#8217;ish ride.

Also I&#8217;ve placed a link to a spreadsheet that I started last year that is a composition of the statistics from my cyclometer
