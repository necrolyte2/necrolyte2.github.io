I finished tweaking some of the colors and positions of stuff just in time for the domain name(tygertown.us) to update to the new site. Also, it is about 50 degrees out right now and that means its fix bike time. Hopefully I will have both my bikes up and running smooth today and can maybe get out with the roadbike for a spin today. If not I can go tomorrow as it is suppose to be like 65 degrees. It will be a battle of whether to play Frisbee or bike tomorrow
