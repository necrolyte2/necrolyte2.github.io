Why pay for hosting which is like $120/yr when I can just pay wordpress.com to do it for me for like $13/yr

So you will notice for the time being that my domain is redirecting to tygertown.wordpress.com

This will continue until my hosting contract ends and then I will do some magic with the domain name.
