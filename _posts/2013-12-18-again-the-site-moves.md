In my quest to find a cheap awesome hosting provider, my friend <a title="Pantleg" href="http://www.pantleg.net/" target="_blank">William</a>(He has a blog he never posts too, what a lameo) and I were talking over the Gchats and he happen to mention <a title="Digital Ocean" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. So I popped open a new tab and first thing I see is $5/mo for a VPS! I was pretty much sold at that point. I don&#8217;t know how they are doing it so cheap, but here you are reading this post from my site which has been transitioned onto a Digital Ocean VPS.

Right now I don&#8217;t have an SSL cert so there is no encryption for when I log in, but I will probably just do a self signed one, since it is only me that really needs it anyways and I can deal with clicking the &#8220;Yes I understand what I am doing&#8221; button.

Some other things that came about from this is that I pushed my Wodpress theme up to github as well as the gravatar image plugin that it uses.
