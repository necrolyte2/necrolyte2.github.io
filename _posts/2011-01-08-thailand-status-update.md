Well I&#8217;m trying a new thing, posting through the wordpress app on my phone.
  
Seems like Mel and I have been in a bit of a day to day groove lately and not much has happened.
  
The holidays seemed to come and go very fast. They don&#8217;t really celebrate Christmas here and with the temperature being in the 80&#8217;s to 90&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to tell it is actually christmas.

They do celebrate the new year similar here as in the states. We went out for dinner with some friends and then went back to our apartment building and played some games and watched the fireworks show.
  
I think the next few months will be busy with some trips coming up and hopefully moving to a new place closer to work.
