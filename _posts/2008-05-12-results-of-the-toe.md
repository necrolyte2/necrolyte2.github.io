So after a bit of time with the doctor and the radiologist here is what was found. I used photoshop on an x-ray I found on the internet to show what it looked like. The doctor used his magical &#8220;push really hard&#8221; abilities to set it in the correct position. So 3 weeks from now I should be set to go.
