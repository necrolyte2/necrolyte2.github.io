A few pictures of my new cast. Its fiberglass on the one side wrapped in an ace bandage so I can take it off for showering and such. The 4th metacarpal is broken but it is in place so it should heal ok.

The second thing is Nate and I are going to sign another 1 year lease on the apartment here and I&#8217;m going to try and save money for a condo or house next year.

Stay tuned for my next post about insurance claims using the MSU healthcare system.
