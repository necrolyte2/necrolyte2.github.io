Recently I have been using GIT so much that I&#8217;ve been considering upgrading my <a title="Necrolyte2's GitHub" href="http://www.github.com/necrolyte2" target="_blank">Github</a> <span>account. The problem is, I don&#8217;t want to pay $7 a month for another service. Yes, yes I know Github is very super awesome and I should probably just pay for the service, BUT&#8230;why when you can make something similar</span> using free services.<!--more-->

<span>Now this obviously doesn&#8217;t have all the awesomeness that Github has, but if you want personal <span>repositories</span> and have a computer at home then you can do this.</span>

  1. Get and install <a title="Dropbox" href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> if you have not already.
  2. <span>Create a folder wherever you want in your Dropbox folder(I suggest in the root of your Dropbox) and name it GITREPOS. You can name it whatever you want, just remember the path.</span>

<span>Now, whenever you want a new <span>repo</span> you should make a bare one in your <span>dropbox</span> folder like so</span>

>  <span>git <span>init</span> &#8211;bare <path to GITREPOS>/<name of new git <span>repo</span>>.git</span>

<span><span>Ok</span> now you have a bare git <span>repository</span> sitting in your GITREPOS directory which is synced, backed up and all that Dropbox goodness, but how to get to it from another computer?</span>

<span>You can either install Dropbox on that computer which takes forever if you have a lot of stuff in your Dropbox account already. OR, you can use</span> Dynamic DNS.

Setup <a title="DynDNS" href="http://www.dyndns.com/" target="_blank"><span><span>DynDNS</span></span></a> on whatever computer you want to do the GITREPO stuff on.

<span>I actually set up <span>DynDNS</span> with 2 hosts.</span>

  * One for my laptop
  * One for just my home network.

<span>So I have a <span>hostname</span> for my laptop that points to it wherever my laptop goes and I also have one dedicated on my home network(I have DynDNSÂ update my home network from my WRT54G. Make sure to forward Port 22 for ssh)</span>

<span>* Note: You can use whatever dynamic <span>DNS</span> service you want. I have just used <span>DynDNS</span> in the past so stuck with it.</span>

You now have:

  * <span>Dropbox syncing your GITREPOS to any computer you setup Dropbox on</span>
  * <span>Dynamic DNS <span>hostname</span> pointing to your computer with your GITREPOS</span>

To complete your Jedi training you should also probably setup some SSH keys for your new host. I&#8217;m not going to go into details on that, but it is quite easy an there is a lot via a <a title="Let Me Google That For You ssh keygen" href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ssh+keygen" target="_blank">Google search</a> about it.

Now that you have full Jedi powers you can do

> <span>git clone <my <span>dyndnshost</span>>:<path to git <span>repo</span> in my <span>dropbox</span>></span>
