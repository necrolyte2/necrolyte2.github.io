William and I both needed some stuff at Walmart so we decided to try out the bus system. Well the plan was to catch the bus at 4:31pm and the bus showed up at like 4:50. Anyways I kinda forgot the stuff that I was going to write about that somebody might care about, so&#8230;.

I bought some new clothes(shorts and a shirt) and some super stylish velcro shoes that will allow me to put my shoes on in a timely fassion.

We are going to a late showing of Rhe Dark Knight&#8230;

I know this is candidate for worst post ever.
