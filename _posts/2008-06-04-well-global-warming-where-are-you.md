Shouldn&#8217;t it be warmer now then ever before? I&#8217;m pretty impressed with how warm its been here now its June and we are just barely breaking into the 60 degree range. All this rain is really making me happy and excited to wake up every day. I don&#8217;t know what I would do if we had a spree of like 3 days where it was in the 70&#8217;s and sunny with NO WIND!

I&#8217;m glad I spent all the time in the winter trying to get in shape so that I could actually go hiking, biking and play ultimate in the summer. The first person that says that they don&#8217;t like it when its warm out gets punched in the face.
