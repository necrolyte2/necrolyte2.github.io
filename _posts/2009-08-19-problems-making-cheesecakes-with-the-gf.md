Mel was tasked with making 2 cheesecakes for various events this week. Last night was dubbed &#8220;Cheesecake Night.&#8221; I brought over my little food processor to aid in the process and it was pretty sweet.

Anyways, onto the problems of making cheesecakes.

**Problem #1** &#8211; I love cheesecake. NO, really, I LOVE CHEESECAKE. I love cream cheese, I love graham crackers, I love butter, I love licking bowls full of cream cheese and mixtures and I apparently love Ginger Snaps.

**Problem #2** &#8211; Because of Problem #1, ingredients become sacrificed to my tummy monster throughout the process of creating the cheesecakes

**Problem #3** &#8211; I love processing stuff in my food processor way to much. I don&#8217;t know why, but its fun.

**Problem #4** &#8211; I cry when I find out that I can&#8217;t eat the entire cheesecake right after its done being made <img src="https://tygertown.us/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

**Problem #5** &#8211; I now know how to make a cheesecake. This is bad because I instincivly think to myself, &#8220;How big of a cheesecake could I make?&#8221;
