Saw the doctor on Wednesday.

He couldn&#8217;t find anything wrong except some soreness in a specific area. He didn&#8217;t think it was anything torn so that is good. He said he can&#8217;t be 100% sure without cutting and/or MRI, but was confident that it was either a bone bruise or a small fiber tear on my MCL that may have torn out a tiny part of bone.

Either way he suggested that I just take it easy on the stuff that makes it hurt and it should repair itself. I really hope it fixes itself soon so I can get out on the fields and practice up and partake in Bozofest.
