Well I headed back to Glendive this last weekend for my Mom&#8217;s birthday. It was really fun and I watched my Dad move a garage which was pretty crazy. During the weekend we had a weiner dog reunion with Wilbur and Pretzel&#8217;s Brother, Sister and Mom. The pups are all 10 and the mom is 13 which is pretty impressive for a weinier dog. Here is a slide show of the reunion.
