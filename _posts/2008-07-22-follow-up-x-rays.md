Well the follow-up x-rays confirmed it. My left leg is hollow and that is where all the food goes to allow me to eat so much. I&#8217;m so funny, but seriously, I had my hand x-rayed again and the doctor was not 100% convinced that the bone is in the right place so he is having me go see the hand specialist at Bridger Orhipedic. Nothing like trying to save money and instead spending it all on doctor visits. At least I&#8217;ll reach my deductable early this year.

Also, just so you know, it is really hard to move with only 1 hand. I managed to move my entire bed and dressers by myself though, which was fun&#8230;not really.
