Well I&#8217;ve finally bit down and signed up for [twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and [ping.fm](http://ping.fm).

Twitter is a micro blogging site that allows you to post quick snippets of what you are currently up to. Last.fm uses this to update other sites for you automatically.

I&#8217;ve added my twitter updates to the right side panel here.
