So I finally got around to getting google analytics setup on my site and let me tell you if you don&#8217;t have it on your site you really need to do so. The statistics it gathers are pretty cool. Where people are coming from, which pages they view, what percentage of people go directly to your site and then leave without going to other pages are just a few of the things you will have access to. Don&#8217;t forget as most things from our new Overloards, its free.

Tech Note:

Also note that it is super easy to install in wordpress. Edit wp-content/themes/<theme name>footer.php in your wordpress directory. Right before the </body> tag insert the google analytics javascript code that you get when you setup your website profile and poof within a day you will have statistics for your site.
