We headed out to a place that we saw the day before when looking for a breakfast place and it was alright.

Back to the apartment to gather our bags and head to the airport.Â <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It eventually had to end <img src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>

Alright now a little discussion on the whole business class thing. It was really expensive. It was actually more expensive to upgrade from economy to business than the actual flight. Would I do it again? For this special occasion, ya. No doubt in my mind. It was the perfect way to finish up the honeymoon. Super awesome legroom. Seats recline as far back as you want. Awesome service.

Would I do it every time I had an 8 hour flight? Probably not unless I had too much money or miles. It will be compelling enough to consider though for really long flights and I highly suggest you do it at least once in your lifetime.

Wow, so hard to believe that those 10 days have already passed us by. Such a great trip. It has made me realize a few things in my life too which I will think about quite a bit and hopefully post about soon.

There will be one more post from the honeymoon that will be titled something like Mega Honeymoon Picture Post where you will finally get all of the pictures from both the camera and our phones. Until then&#8230;o7
