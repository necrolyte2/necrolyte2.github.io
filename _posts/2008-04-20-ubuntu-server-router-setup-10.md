Here it is the simplest way I know of to make a fresh Ubuntu Server a router
  
Download

  * [Installer](http://tygertown.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/install.sh_.gz)
  * [Setup Files](http://tygertown.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/routersetupfiles.tar)

Put them both in the same directory(Doesn&#8217;t matter where) and then execute the install.sh file

I&#8217;ve only tested it on a fresh install of Ubuntu Server. It should work on a non fresh install but I can&#8217;t guarantee anything.
