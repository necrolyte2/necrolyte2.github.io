Well looks like I&#8217;m going to Onionfest this year in Walla Walla, WA.

[googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=bozeman,+mt&daddr=Walla+Walla,+Washington&hl=en&geocode=&mra=pr&sll=46.698435,-114.691772&sspn=3.590302,8.459473&ie=UTF8&ll=46.698435,-114.691772&spn=5.27499,9.338379&z=6&output=embed&w=425&h=350]

According to Google its 578 mi or about 8 hours 37 mins. In the past its apparently been either really nice or really crappy. The weather is predicted to be in the 50&#8217;s and decent. Lets hope that the forecast stays that way. I&#8217;ll make sure to bring my photographing device to document the trip and post the pics here.

Edit:
  
So this is for an Ultimate Frisbee tournament
