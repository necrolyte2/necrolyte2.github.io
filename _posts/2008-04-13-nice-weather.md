Finally it was nice out, really nice out. It was around 65-70 degrees and the sun was shining making it even warmer. I&#8217;ve cleaned both of my bikes, just need to take them to the power washer now with some degreaser to shine them up good. Then I&#8217;ll polish them and lube them and I&#8217;ll be set to go. We even got some Ultimate in today, even though it wasn&#8217;t that great of a game it was just good to play outside.
