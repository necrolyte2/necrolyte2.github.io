I suppose it is that time where I&#8217;m tired of the current look of the site and I want to change it a bit. This is my first attempt at creating a WordPress theme from scratch, so bare with me.

<!--more-->There are a few things still missing(categories, tags, links, pages, THE SIDEBAR), but I think for now this will do and I&#8217;ll slowly transition the remaining items into the new design.

I&#8217;m also planning on dropping the current landing page and pushing the blog as the sole CMS for the site. This should be a fun Apache Redirect adventure since I still want the existing links(/blog/<post>) to be available since Google Analytics still shows quite a bit of traffic going to some older posts.

Anyways, please feel free to comment on what you like and don&#8217;t like about the new theme if you feel inclined.
