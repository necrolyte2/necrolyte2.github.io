Everybody is going to make mistakes. I would even venture out there and say, don&#8217;t worry about them&#8230;well I almost would say that. Mistakes are probably the best way to learn in my opinion. Nobody is perfect.

Now lets drop out of that euphoric dreamy world and get a bit closer to reality. While there are a lot of &#8220;learning mistakes&#8221; I fear that there are far too many &#8220;ignorant mistakes.&#8221; Of which, I have pretty much zero tolerance for when they happen around me. I&#8217;m not saying that I don&#8217;t make these dumb mistakes too, but I have a very low tolerance when I see people making them over and over. It is just a sign to me that person is either not putting forth their best effort or, dare I say, unintelligent.<!--more-->

Let&#8217;s take a look at the word intelligence:

Making mistakes isn&#8217;t the only way to acquire knowledge and skills, but not being able to identify that you are making the same mistake over and over does indicate a lack of the whole acquiring portion of the definition.

I&#8217;d like to narrow the focus now to making mistakes when dealing with computers. More so to how you create files and such(because really, I&#8217;m here to complain about something that I have to deal with right now and that has to deal with naming files). If you create a lot of files on your computer by hand here are some things you are probably doing that will make me Super Rage Quite.

  * Not putting any thought into why you are naming the files the way you are
  * Not standardizing the naming scheme
  * Not defining a hierarchy to your files(Most things fall into a hierarchy even if you don&#8217;t initially think they do)

If you mindlessly do things over and over you will create a problem that falls into the RAGE QUIT scenario. 15,000 files and 1024 folders later you have just won the fail face award. You get to wear a dunce hat for the rest of the year.

Moral of the story is, if you are going to make a ton of mistakes, at least make them all in the same way. Don&#8217;t make them random mistakes. That is a much harder problem to fix. Also, it seems easier to identify yourself that you are being dumb when you keep making the exact same mistake. Ya, as a computer scientist, I strive to make the assumption that everything is related to another problem and that there is somehow a solution to both of them&#8230;or something. Classes, objects, polymorphism and stuff.

I&#8217;m going to quit now since I am obviously just babbling on at this point&#8230;.like always I guess.
