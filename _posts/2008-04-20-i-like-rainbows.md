So I&#8217;m sitting in my room with my blinds open Friday after work and I look outside and notice this. I quickly grabbed my camera and popped a few shots. The lighting outside was crazy, something with the clouds and the sunset made it very eerie out.

Of course there were about 5 power/telephone lines across the photo and I did my best to remove them with Photoshop, which was pretty time consuming because I have no idea how to do it correctly.
