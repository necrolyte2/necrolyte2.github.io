Here are the answers to all of those common questions I&#8217;ve been getting

### Am I getting a job here in Bangkok?

> I&#8217;m currently in the process of squaring away a teaching position at one of the universities here in Bangkok. I would be teaching a Computer Science class for undergrads. It is not formalized nor set in stone yet, but sounds very hopeful.

### When am I coming back and for how long?

> Just booked a round trip ticket from May 12 &#8211; Jun 4 in/out of Bozeman

### What am I doing while I&#8217;m back?

> First two days I&#8217;ll be recovering from the jetlag and cramming as much stuff into my car as possible. That weekend I&#8217;ll drive to Miles City for BHS. I&#8217;ll spend the 17th &#8211; 27th in Glendive. Come back to Bozeman for Bozofest. Then I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m getting my car back to Glendive while staying in Bozeman for my return flight on that Friday the 4th of June.

### How long am I going back to Thailand for?

> Until I&#8217;m elected king&#8230;j/k. Until Mel is finished here which will be up to 3ish years.

### Do you have an awesome new phone that is better than any other phone you have ever had?

> Why yes I do. Thanks for asking. I bought a Nexus one and have loved it like a small portable electronic child ever since I got it.

### Do I have a very special great Aunt that reads my blog?

> According to a little birdie I&#8217;ve been told that my great Aunt Kitty has been reading my blog. Thanks for spending the time to keep up with what I am doing.
