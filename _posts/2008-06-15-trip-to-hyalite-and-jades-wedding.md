Well I made it all the way to the reservoir yesterday. It was a pretty sweet ride and only took about an hour and 10 minutes to go from my house to the top. The ride down was pretty sweet, although very windy.
  
I took these with my super duper phone camera

When I finally got back to the apartment I was pretty tired and had a 2 hour nap and then zapped some red bull to get me going again so I could get out to Jade and Amber&#8217;s Wedding.

I did the sound for the ceremony and also took pictures, even though I forgot my memory card again. I have to remember to put the card back in the camera when I transfer pictures off of it. Anyways, the wedding and reception were really fun and everybody had a blast.

Congratulations Jade and Amber!
