I&#8217;m feeling pericularily good about our military right now. I&#8217;ve often wondered why I feel so inclined to fight for them in the past but I feel like I have finally found the reason. I know its weird, but watching Transformers again I realized that their relentless fight against whatever they are told to do whether good or bad they will do it. They fight for our freedom regardless of the situation and always have. The courage and honor they portray is always inspiring and I give my full support to any soldier of our freedom.
