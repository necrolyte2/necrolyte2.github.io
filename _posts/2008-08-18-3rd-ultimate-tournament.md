I attended my 3rd ultimate tournament which is the first one that I have been to with the Bozo&#8217;s.

It was really fun. We had some excellent games Saturday and went 3-1 beating Jackson, Cody, Salt Lake and then loosing to Missoula in a close one.

Sunday we went 0-1 losing to Salt Lake really bad. Things just didn&#8217;t work out too well on Sunday for us during that game, but none the less it was fun.
