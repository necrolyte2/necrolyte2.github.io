Well it was a good 65 degrees and sunny out today. Finally good weather. We pulled together some of the frisbee squad and played some ultimate at 2 today. It was super nice weather for playing. Not super warm and not cold, just perfect with a tad of wind.

We played until about 4:30 and then people had to go do stuff.

Last night I went with Brad up near fairy lake for a bonfire. There was about 8 inches of snow up there and actually was not that cold. I&#8217;ve never really gone up for a bonfire with him before and it was a lot of fun.
