It is no question that I hate meetings. Not just hate, but really hate. Really what I hate is wasting time at work while somebody talks about something I really could care less about.

Here are a list of things that drive me nuts about the typical meeting:

  * No agenda or a very loose agenda
  * People talking about things in the meeting with little relevance to the majority of the attendees. Schedule a smaller meeting with people involved instead.
  * If there are items that require somebody to do something after the meeting label them action items that require those people to follow up with each other.
  * Not setting time limits for each topic. Please please do this.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I understand that meetings are important, but they need to have a fixed agenda and follow some rules or people will just time out and negate the importance of the meeting.
