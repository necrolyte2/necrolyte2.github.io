Well I&#8217;ve made it back to Montanimerica safely. Just in time for the protests in Bangkok to go wild. Somehow I had this weird feeling that as soon as I left things would get more interesting over there. I think it is good to note though that I don&#8217;t feel completely worried about leaving Mel there though, as our apartment is far enough away that she is safe. I do worry about how she is stuck alone in the apartment all the time though and I get to venture out and do fun stuff, but I&#8217;ll be back soon enough.

So I don&#8217;t have a phone either so getting a hold of me while I&#8217;m back is really fun. Facebook or Email is the easiest.

So, onto the agenda for my time back

  1. Bucking Horse Sale
  2. Visit Glendive and eat a bunch
  3. Move stuff out of apartment in Bozeman
  4. Visit Glendive more and eat more
  5. Bozofest
  6. Work week @ MSU
  7. Fly back
