I&#8217;ve been subscribing to different google blogs just to keep tabs on our internet overloards. I found [this](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/new-gmail-code-base-now-for-ie6-too.html) article to be quite interesting. Specifically this part

> Over the last few months, we&#8217;ve been working with the IE engineers at Microsoft to address these issues: they released a critical update to their JavaScript implementation that fixed a performance problem with how the script engine allocates and frees memory.

Pretty interesting that it takes an outside team from your competitors to fix bugs in your own browser code. I know that I&#8217;ve been known to put a little hate on the Microsoft(especially Internet Explorer) while showing only love to Google, but I don&#8217;t feel bias at all about pointing out the fact that Microsoft should probably quite trying to force IE at gunpoint through ridiculous ways and maybe instead spend the time focusing on making their browser just work.
