Things have been going full blast here since we arrived in late April/early May. New jobs, new apartment, new area to live in and wedding planning are the top things that have been the main highlights since we moved. Just those things alone have kept us pretty busy lately.

This Friday we had some friends visit from Boston just in time for an awesome storm that left a massive power outage in the greater Washington dc area.
  
The power outage has revealed a significant disadvantage of living on the 14th floor. No power = no water. 

Instead of sticking around in the war zone, we packed up and headed off on an adventure with no plan. Gettysburg yesterday and Philadelphia today. I can smell the chez wiz that I will be consuming later already.

Maybe liberty bell after? Who knows, but still have to work on Monday from the sounds of it.
