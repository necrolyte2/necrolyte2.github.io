As I helped William fix a computer in the SUB I randomly came across a few memories from my childhood that may help parents out there know that their child is going to grow up to become a nerd and/or geek.

  * Loves Legos (This love never goes away and is the building block for an engineer)
  * Takes things apart just to see whats inside and then puts it back together
  * After you teach them something new on the computer they immediately turn around and teach you something even better.
  * Tinkers with things all by themselves for the first 12 years of their life &#8230; and then the next 12 years too
  * Enjoys Star (Trek|Wars) too much
  * Makes fun of other kids because they can&#8217;t configure their Mom and Dad&#8217;s TCP/IP settings
  * All the friends of your child seem to be nerdy to you but your child is just fine and not nerdy or geeky at all.

Just a few of the many signs.
