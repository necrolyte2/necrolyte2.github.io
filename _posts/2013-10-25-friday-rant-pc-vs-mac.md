I know, I missed a Friday and Friday rants need to come every Friday, but last week was a hard week and we were prepping to go to Boston so I didn&#8217;t get to write it on Friday.

Let me just start with these little statements:

> P.C. is an acronym for Personal Computer. That is a computer you can use for personal usage.
> 
> Mac is just short for Macintosh which was a model of computer built by the Apple Computer Company.

Alright, now that we got that straight I hope you can see clearly that one is a subset of the other. A Mac is a PC just as much as a Dell, HP, IBM or Toshiba are a PC. Really to make the argument though I would say something like, a Latitude, Envy, Thinkpad or Satellite are a PC.

If you look at the specs of any of the laptops you will see that Apple, Dell, IBM, HP and Toshiba all are currently running the Intel chipsets with Intel/NVIDIA/ATI graphics cards. They all have a hard drive, speakers and a screen&#8230; There is no difference between any of them as far as hardware goes. Don&#8217;t even try to say anything about BIOS differences because EFI is becoming more standard with all manufacturers as well.

Just because it is an Apple computer doesn&#8217;t make it &#8220;more stable&#8221; or &#8220;less prone to viruses&#8221;. Those statements and the like tend to boil my blood due to the ignorance of the statement. Those statements better suited for the whole Windows vs. *Nix debate. The only argument that could be made is that Apple somehow is better at selecting individual hardware pieces that are less prone to going bad&#8230;ha!

Really the only valid arguments that I can see for picking an Apple PC over say Dell or what not is that you like the hardware design, but I&#8217;ll argue to the grave that you are just paying more for your computer to look pretty and nothing more which I guess is your choice. All the major manufacturers have pretty nice looking models somewhere in their lineups.

FYI, if stability is your argument then you should check out the <a title="Free BSD" href="http://www.freebsd.org/" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a>/<a title="Open BSD" href="http://www.openbsd.org/" target="_blank">OpenBSD</a> projects.

Don&#8217;t become a hipster and pick Apple because that is what all the Cool kids are doing!
