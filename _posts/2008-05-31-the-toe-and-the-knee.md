Well I went to frisbee practice last night and I could semi-jog just to the point that the toe started hurting which means its getting close. Maybe another week or so and it will be set. The knee is really undecided as I cannot run with my toe the way it is yet.

Ohh ya, and this morning the weather was nice enough to go out on the bike. Yay!!
