So it has been something I have been meaning to do since we got here and finally I was able to go. Our friend Bob Bowden who runs [www.thelink-up.org](http://www.thelink-up.org "The Link Up") took me out with him and another guy fishing for Barramundi which are a fairly big fish that fights a lot.

Bob is the guy with the big smile in the foreground of the far right image and also the one with the fish in the second picture. The trip had a guide as well that was very nice. His name was Neil and he runs a fishing guide company here in Thailand. I&#8217;m going to get his info so maybe I can get out again sometime.

The place we went to is the largest fish farm in Thailand and is almost completely stocked with these fish. I took a few pictures of the surrounding area.

Here is a snapshot of me holding one of the fish I caught. I think overall I caught somewhere between 5 &#8211; 15 fish during the day. The largest was 16 pounds and the smallest was 12 pounds. I can&#8217;t remember exactly how many I caught because in the beginning I was bringing one in almost every 2-3 minutes it seemed like. It slowed down a bit later in the day for Bob and myself, however, Cory was the magic man and just kept reeling them in.
