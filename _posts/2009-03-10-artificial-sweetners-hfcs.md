With all the recent studies done on Artificial Sweetners like Splenda and Aspartame, as well as the similar studies done on High Fructose Corn Syrup I am going to try and stop consuming them for about three months just to see what happens. Apparently they mess with your bodies &#8220;stop eating&#8221; mechanism and I think the studies are right. The midnight &#8211; 2am food cravings as well as just the general ones only a little while after eating are driving me crazy.

What I will be missing:
  
&#8211; Diet Mtn. Dew(My primary source of caffeine, watch out people I&#8217;m a cranky tired person)
  
&#8211; Rockstar
  
&#8211; Red Bull
  
&#8211; Soda/Pop in general
  
&#8211; Almost every food that has any processing done to it(Yay American Corn industry)
