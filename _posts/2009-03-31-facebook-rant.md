I feel it necessary to rant a bit on the current status of Facebook. There once was a day that I could easily go to the site and find whatever I wanted. For instance, I wanted to go to Facebook and find the groups I was in. That was easy back in the day. Now, I have to spend 5 minutes just to find the list of all my groups.

Now to address the issue of Facebook Groups. I think they are fine, however, why can&#8217;t I be notified when people post in a group that I am in. Please give me the option to check something that at least puts something in my profile or sends me a message so that I know when people have done something. There are so many times that I&#8217;m in a group that has pretty important information yet it goes unread because I have no way of being notified.
