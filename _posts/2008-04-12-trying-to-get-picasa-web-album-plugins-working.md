So I&#8217;ve spent about 5 hours trying to get any of the many Picasa plugins to actually work. Apparently WordPress 2.5 must have changed a bunch of stuff and all of the plugins that I have tried have failed in one way or another. Some really neat ones that I really wish would have worked too.

So after all that, I find this

Picasa already has an embed link for an album. Guess I&#8217;ll use that for now then.
