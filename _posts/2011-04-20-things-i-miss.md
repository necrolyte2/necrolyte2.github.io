  * People who walk fast
  * Grass
  * Driving
  * Cooking
  * Pizza, no not the stone oven ones like you find here that are awesome, sloppy huge pizza&#8217;s that I can&#8217;t eat by myself&#8230;well I can but they are much bigger
  * 317 Pub + Trivia
  * Pour House food before Trivia
  * Microbrews

  * Islands, beaches
  * Pretty cheap
  * Adventure
  * All the restaurants
  * Super cheap phone / internet(although maybe not the best service)
