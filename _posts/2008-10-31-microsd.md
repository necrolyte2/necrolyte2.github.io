So basically I was wowed by how small this things really are. I recently purchased a MicroSD from Woot.com for like $15. Pretty good deal for a 4Gb card.

So essentially MicroSD is used in things like Cell Phones and other small devices. You can get readers for them however this one came with an SD card that has a MicroSD slot built into it. You just slide the MicroSD card into the SD card and then your computer reads the SD card which is awesome.

Check out how small it is.
