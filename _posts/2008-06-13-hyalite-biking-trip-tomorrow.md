Well its a good 17 miles all uphill and then 17 awesome miles back. Should be a good 1-2 hour adventure. Its suppose to be nice out for like a whole week and I&#8217;m going to try my best to utilize the nice weather, starting tonight with Frisbee, which was awesome, and continuing through next week.
