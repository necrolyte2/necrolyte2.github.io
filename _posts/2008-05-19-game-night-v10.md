We decided to kick off the summer with a game night hosted in the labs this Saturday. Starting around 6pm 8 of us started playing Diablo II. It was just a bunch of ridiculousness. Everything went very smooth. We had a movie playing on the projector the whole time we were playing, although we really didn&#8217;t watch much of the movies that played they were mostly background noise as we hammered our ways through Baal&#8217;s minions. We all topped off at about lvl 30-33 with various characters. We will definatly do this again as it went so well, however, probably start around 12-2pm this time since it ran until 3am.
