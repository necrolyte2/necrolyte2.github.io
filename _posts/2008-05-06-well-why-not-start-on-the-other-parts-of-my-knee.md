I&#8217;ve gone through an ACL in both knees and those were pretty exciting. The second surgery did get me into biking which is pretty good. So now it seems that I&#8217;m back to knee #1 and working on different ligaments. Something happened last week during our first Intramurals tournament game near the end. I dove for a frisbee and must have done something to my knee. This was different than the other knee injuries as I didn&#8217;t notice it at first, but that night it got pretty sore. I had trouble that night sleeping on it and the next day it was pretty stiff.

Its been exactly a week and walking and jumping straight up and down don&#8217;t hurt however if I twist at all on that leg all sorts of pain happen. I&#8217;m making a trip to Bridger Orthopedic tomorrow morning to find out for sure whats going on. I&#8217;m guessing MCL sprain, but only time will tell.
