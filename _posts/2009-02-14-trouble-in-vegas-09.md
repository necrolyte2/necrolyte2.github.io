Well we made it there and back. Bad weather was the last thing on my mind when going there, but it was terrible. Windy, 40 some degrees on Friday. Nate and I missed the first game due a mishap with the bus system, but arrived and played the next 2 games. We went 1-2 that day.Â 

I awoke Saturday to overcast skys. We stepped out of the motel, I saw my breath and the pouring rain and turned around and went back into the motel. The team apprently went like 3-1 or 4-1 that day somehow playing through that weather.

Sunday, we made it down to the fields to find about an inch to 3 inches of mud all over the fields. The day went well and we ended up 2-1 or 3-0 for the day, I can&#8217;t remember if we lost a game or not.
