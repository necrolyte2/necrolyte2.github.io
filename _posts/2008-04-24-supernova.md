Interesting movie. Acting was a bit poor, but it seemed like it wasn&#8217;t the highest budget film. The movie left me feeling slightly entertained, but I didn&#8217;t think it was the best movie.

The plot could have been decent, however, the execution of getting to the plot was pretty bad. Also, don&#8217;t just kill off characters that you spend time developing their character. You can kill one or two off but when the cast is only about 6 you probably shouldn&#8217;t just toss 2 of them away one after another. Its hard to say in writing but they way they did it in this movie just didn&#8217;t feel right.

Netflix rating: 3 / 5 stars

My rating: 5 / 10 stars
