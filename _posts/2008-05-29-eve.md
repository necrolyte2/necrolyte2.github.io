Well I got curious again and tried it out again tonight. I really don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m going to be able to play for a long time. The whole time I played it just felt like a burden and I wanted to just quit but of course we had to make a 43 jump move which was no fun at all.

Anyways ya, stupid weather causing me to start back in on bad habits.
