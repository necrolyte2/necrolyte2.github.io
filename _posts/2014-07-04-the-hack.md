Maybe you noticed, but most likely you didn&#8217;t, but tygertown.us and melaniemelendrez.com were down for a while. Tygertown was only down for about 5 hours but Melanie&#8217;s site was down until today.
  
<!--more-->

Basically, one of the WordPress installations(that is the software that runs our sites) was out of date and somebody took advantage of a vulnerability that the older version had and got some malicious code to run on the site. The code didn&#8217;t seem to do anything to bad other than try to break into other people&#8217;s sites&#8230;.

Anyways, long story short, the sites are back up and now I&#8217;ve taken a few different measures to hopefully secure them more so it doesn&#8217;t happen again
