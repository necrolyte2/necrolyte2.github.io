So one of the big headaches I had was getting cell service when I got here.

The process is actually so unbelievably simple, it was just the language barrier that got me.

### Prerequisite

As long as you have an unlocked phone that has a sim card slot you are set.
  
If you are coming from the US then you probably have either Verizon, ATT, Tmobile or Cingular as a provider. Verizon phones do not have sim card slots with the exception of a few. The other providers do use phones with sim card slots and you just need to call tech support before you leave and tell them to unlock your phone and they should do that. If they won&#8217;t then skip down to buying a cheap Asian phone.

### Knowing your phone&#8217;s frequencies

Your phone can only operate over certain frequencies. It is confusing at first to figure this out. It took me some time to really grasp it all, but hopefully I can explain it easily.

First off you need to know if your phone is GSM or CDMA. Pretty easy if you come from america. SPRINT, Verizon and Virgin Mobile are all CDMA I&#8217;m pretty sure. AT&T and TMobile are both GSM. If you have one of the other carriers then you might just do some googling or call the company to find out. If you have CDMA then just hauk that piece of crap on Ebay and buy a GSM phone when you get there if you are moving there or buy a crappy $20 phone over there. If you have Tmobile or AT&T then you are set. Now this isn&#8217;t 100% because it really actually depends on the phone itself, but AT&T means you need to go with DTAC or True Mobile and Tmobile means you need to go with AIS. I think that starting with the newer Android and Apple phones they actually support all the 3G bands so it won&#8217;t matter what company you go with.

All of the providers are more or less the same as far as service(at least when I left Bangkok) so if you are lucky enough to have an iPhone 4/5 or newer Android then you can pick whoever. I want to say that DTAC is the most mature of all of the companies and True Mobile is the hipster upcoming company. AIS felt like it was a bit older and very corporate&#8230;or something. It really doesn&#8217;t matter since you can just switch to a different company if you want fairly easily.

### Buying a cheap asian phone

You won&#8217;t be able to escape phone retailers here. Especially if you go to the MBK market. Basically just find a shop somewhere and buy a cheap phone. You are probably only looking for texting and calling anyways and all phones have this.

### Purchasing a sim card

You have two options to get a sim card. If you just want talk+text  go to the nearest 7-Eleven. If you want internet on your phone (who doesn&#8217;t at like $15/month) and you are not tech savvy, go to a retail store in a bigger mall like Siam and have them setup everything. If I remember right, it took me some time to get my internet going on my phone when I first got my AIS sim card. I think that in order do do post-pay accounts you need to provide a Work permit or similar VISA if I remember correctly. I wouldn&#8217;t do post-pay though anyways as there didn&#8217;t seem to be any benefits that made it really worth it.

If you decide to do 7-Eleven then there are just a few things to note. DTAC&#8217;s pay as you go plan is called Happy, it is easiest to just say, &#8220;Happy Sim&#8221; to the teller. They will likely pull out a bunch of thin square packages eventually that have like 10 digit numbers on them. These are the sim cards and the numbers are the phone numbers associated with that sim card. Typically sim cards cost 50 baht I think, or 100 either way they come with 50 baht of calling on them which is quite a bit if you are texting/calling in Thailand. If you plan on calling out to the US/Europe then you are looking at about 10-14 baht per minute or about 30-40 cents which is quite a bit, but usually they run promotions and if you dial like 4 + <us/europe number> its only 4 baht per minute.

### Data Plan

If you want to have Internet and such on your phone then you will have to visit a booth for the company you buy your sim card from. Just tell them you want a data plan and they will give you a pamphlet with all the prices. You can do a per/MB plan or a per/hour plan depending on the type of phone you have. If you have a smart phone(Android/Iphone/Windows mobile) you will probably want to do a per/MB plan. Last time I did a 500MB plan and its looking like I will only use about 300MB. The plan cost me like 300 baht or LESS THAN $15!!!! If you have a blackberry you will need to do a blackberry plan as they need funky stuff to work(sell that piece of crap). All other phones you can do a per hour plan for really cheap.

### Refill Card

So you want to put more money on your sim card. You will need to visit 7-Eleven again. This time ask for a refill card. They will probably understand a number followed by the word happy. They sell 50, 100 and 500. Maybe they sell 200 & 300 too, I don&#8217;t remember. If you feel adventures you can try it in Thai. Remember there are tones with some of these so they may not fully understand ha unless you say haaa but go from a high tone to a low tone. When you say roy roll the r

  * ha sib baht = 50 baht
  * ning roy baht = 100 baht
  * song roy baht = 200 baht
  * sam roy bath = 300 baht
  * ha roy baht = 500 baht
