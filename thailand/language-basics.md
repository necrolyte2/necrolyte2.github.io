Here are a bunch of useful phrases written in English as best as I can. [This](http://www.learningthai.com/speak_thai.html "Speak thai") website is really good. They have the English translation as well as voice overs of how to say each phrase. I&#8217;m just putting the most used ones on this page for you

If you are a girl replace kaap with kaa in the following phrases

Krap doesn&#8217;t sound like crap. You need to roll the r. If you say crop or even cop you are pretty close.

  * Hello(all times of day, there is no good night/morning/afternoon) &#8211; Sawat dee krap
  * Thank you &#8211; Kabpoon krap
  * Food &#8211; ahaan 
      * Chicken &#8211; Gkai ( it&#8217;s like a combination of g and k )
