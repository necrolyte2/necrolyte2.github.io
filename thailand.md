I figured since I&#8217;m going to be here for a while I would throw up a page about this new foreign land and why I am over here.

Mel has take a fellowship with a place called [AFRIMS](www.afrims.org "Afrims Homepage")(Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science). Since she was moving over to Thailand(Bangkok to be more particular) I thought it was an awesome opportunity to widen my horizons. So, here we are in Bangkok. She is working at AFRIMS and currently I am working remotely for Montana State University while I hunt down a more permanent position here in Bangkok to land a non-immigrant VISA.

I&#8217;ll be keeping my blog up to date with the latest of things that we do which will include pictures and movies and all sorts of fun things like that so that is where the most up-to-date information will be at.

* * *I figured that I would try to put up information about the country from what I have learned to make it easier for others to travel here in the future. There are quite a few little things that were hard to figure out at first that actually were very simple. Because of the language and cultural differences they became harder than they should have been. I&#8217;ll also post a few things about little things that we experienced that maybe we didn&#8217;t expect as well just as a heads up so you don&#8217;t get caught offÂ guard.</p> 

Since we live in Bangkok these all apply to the city, but a lot of them can apply to outside the city as well.
